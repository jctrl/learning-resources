# Agile Methodologies
### Agile Manifesto

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from acouple of weeks to a couple of months, with apreference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals.

* Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development.

* The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

### SCRUM

Scrum is a framework for building a product. Scrum begins when some stakeholders need a product.
Scrum is a team process. The Scrum Team includes three roles, the Product Owner, the
ScrumMaster, and the members of the Development Team. 

The Product Owner has responsibility for deciding what work will be done. 

The ScrumMaster acts as a servant leader, helping the team and the organization make the best use of Scrum. 

The Development Team builds the product incrementally, in a series of short time periods
called Sprints.

 A Sprint is a fixed time period, from one to four weeks, with a preference toward shorter intervals. In each Sprint the Scrum Team will build and deliver a Product Increment. Each increment is a recognizable, visibly improved, operating subset of the product, meeting understood acceptance criteria and built to a level of quality called the Definition of Done.

Scrum includes three essential artifacts, the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and
the Product Increment. The Product Backlog is the ordered list of ideas for the product,
kept in the order we expect to build them. 

The Sprint Backlog is the detailed plan for development in the next Sprint. The Product Increment is a required result of every Sprint.
 It is an integrated version of the product, kept at high enough quality to be shippable if the Product Owner chooses to ship it. 

In addition to these artifacts, Scrum requires transparency within the team and with the stakeholders. As such, the Scrum Team produces visible displays of plans and progress.

Scrum includes five Activities or meetings. These are Product Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

#### The Scrum framework in 30 seconds

1.     A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
2.     During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
3.     The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
4.     Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
5.     At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
6.     The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
7.     As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

#### Scrum values
*     Focus. Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.
*     Courage. Because we are not alone, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
*     Openness. As we work together, we practice expressing how we're doing and what's in our way. We learn that it is good to express concerns so that they can be addressed.
*     Commitment. Because we have great control over our own destiny, we become more committed to success.
*     Respect. As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.

#### Scrum Roles

##### Product Owner

The product owner has responsibility for deciding what work will be done. 
This is the single individual who is responsible for bringing forward the most valuable product possible by the desired date. 
The product owner does this by managing the flow of work to the team, selecting and refining items from the product backlog. 
The product owner maintains the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows what is on it and what the priorities are. The product owner may be supported by other individuals but must be a single person.

Nonetheless, the product owner, in Scrum, is in a unique position. The product owner is typically the individual closest to the "business side" of the project. 
The product owner is charged by the organization to "get this product out" and is the person who is expected to do the best possible job of satisfying all the stakeholders. 
The product owner does this by managing the product backlog and by ensuring that the backlog, and progress against it, is kept visible.

The product owner, by choosing what the development team should do next and what to defer, makes the scope-versus-schedule decisions that should lead to the best possible product.

##### Scrum Master

The ScrumMaster is a "servant leader" who helps the rest of the Scrum team follow the process. The ScrumMaster must have a good understanding of the Scrum framework and the ability to train others in its subtleties.

The ScrumMaster helps the product owner understand how to create and maintain the product backlog. He or she works with the entire Scrum team to evolve the Definition of Done. The ScrumMaster also works with the development team to find and implement the technical practices needed to get to Done at the end of each sprint.

Another responsibility of the ScrumMaster is to remove impediments to the team’s progress. These impediments may be external to the team (such as a lack of support from another team) or internal (such as the product owner not knowing how to properly prepare the product backlog). That said, the ScrumMaster fosters self-organization, meaning that the team itself should remove issues wherever possible.

The ScrumMaster may facilitate meetings and always acts as a coach for the Scrum team, helping it execute the Scrum process. He or she helps team members work together and learn the Scrum framework, and protects them from both internal and external distractions. The ScrumMaster keeps the Scrum team on track, productive, and growing in ability.

Ultimately, the ScrumMaster is responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood and in place, inside the team and outside. He or she helps people outside the team understand the process and the kinds of interactions with the team that are helpful (and those that are not). The ScrumMaster helps everyone improve to make the Scrum team more productive and valuable.


##### Development Team

The development team is made up of the professionals who do the work of delivering the product increment. Scrum requires that the development team be a cross-functional group of people who, as a group, have all the necessary skills to deliver each increment of the product.

The development team members are expected to be available to the project full time, not splitting their time over numerous projects. They have the responsibility of self-organizing to accomplish each sprint goal, producing each new product increment according to each sprint plan.

The product owner makes an ordered list of what needs to be done; the development team members forecast how much they can do in one sprint, and they decide how they are going to do it.

### Scrum Artifacts

The primary artifact in Scrum development is, of course, the product itself. The Scrum model expects the team to bring the product or system to a potentially shippable state at the end of each Scrum sprint.

**Product Backlog**- The Product Backlog is an essential artifact in Scrum. The Product Backlog is an ordered list of ideas for the product, kept in the order we expect to do them. It is the
single source from which all requirements flow. This means that all work the Development Team does comes from the Product Backlog. 
Every feature idea, enhancement, bug fix, documentation requirement -- every bit of work they do -- is derived from a Product Backlog item. Each item on the Product Backlog includes a
description and an estimate.
The Product Backlog may begin as a large list or a short one. It may be vague or rather
detailed. Typically it begins short and vague and becomes longer and more concrete as time goes on. 
Product Backlog items slated for implementation soon will be "refined": clarified, better defined, split into smaller chunks, as part of the Product Backlog.

The Product Owner is responsible and accountable for maintaining the Product Backlog, although the Product Owner may -- and should -- have help in producing it and keeping it up to date. Product Backlog items may originate from the Product Owner, from team members, or from other stakeholders

**Example:** http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog/example/

***

**Sprint backlog**-  The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the Scrum sprint. During the sprint planning meeting, the team selects some number of product backlog items, usually in the form of user stories, and identifies the tasks necessary to complete each user story. Most teams also estimate how many hours each task will take someone on the team to complete.

It's critical that the team selects the items and size of the sprint backlog. Because they are the people committing to completing the tasks, they must be the people to choose what they are committing to during the Scrum sprint.

The sprint backlog is commonly maintained as a spreadsheet, but it is also possible to use your defect tracking system or any of a number of software products designed specifically for Scrum or agile. An example of a sprint backlog in a spreadsheet looks like this:
Example of sprint backlog:

![Sprint backlog](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/uploads/blog/SprintBacklog.jpg)

The team does its best to pull the right amount of work into the Scrum sprint, but sometimes too much or too little work is pulled in during planning. In this case, the team needs to add or remove tasks.
***

**Sprint** - is a fixed time period, up to four weeks long but with a preference toward shorter intervals. During each sprint, the Scrum team builds and delivers a product increment. Each increment is a recognizable, visibly improved, operating subset of the product, meeting understood acceptance criteria and built to a level of quality referred to as the Definition of Done.

Scrum also includes five activities or meetings. These are the backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.

***

### Sprint Planning

Each Sprint begins with a time-boxed meeting called Sprint Planning. In this meeting the Scrum Team collaborates to select and understand the work to be done in the upcoming Sprint.
The entire team attends the Sprint Planning meeting. Working from the ordered
Product Backlog, the Product Owner and the Development Team Members discuss each item and come to a shared understanding of that item and what is required to complete it consistent with the current Definition of Done. 
All Scrum meetings are time-boxed. The recommended time for the Sprint Planning meeting is two hours or less perweek of Sprint duration. Because the meeting is time-boxed, the success of the Sprint
Planning meeting is highly dependent upon the quality of the Product Backlog going in.
This is why Product Backlog Refinement is an important Scrum activity.
In Scrum, the Sprint Planning meeting is described as having two parts:
* Determine what work will be completed in the Sprint;
* Determine how the work will be accomplished.

##### Part One: What work will be done

In the first part of the meeting, the Product Owner presents ordered Product Backlog items to the Development Team, and the whole Scrum Team collaborates to understand the work.

The number of Product Backlog items to undertake in the Sprint is solely up to the
Development Team. To decide how many items to undertake, the Development Team considers the current state of the Product Increment, the past performance of the team,the team's current capacity, and the ordered Product Backlog. The Development Team alone decides how much work to take on. Neither the Product Owner, nor any other agency, can push more work onto the Development Team.

Often, but not always, the Sprint is given a goal, called the Sprint Goal. This is a very
strong practice which helps everyone focus more on the essence of what needs to be
done, and less on small details which may not be important to what we really need to
accomplish.

**Part Two: How will the work be accomplished?**
In the second part of the meeting, the Development Team collaborates to decide how to
produce the next Product Increment in accord with the current Definition of Done. They
do sufficient design and planning to be confident of completing the work during the
Sprint. Work to be done in the early days is broken down into small units of one day or
less. Work to be done later may be left in larger units to be decomposed later.
Deciding how to do the work is the responsibility of the Development Team, just as
deciding what to do is the responsibility of the Product Owner.
The Product Owner may remain during this part of the meeting, to answer questions
and resolve misunderstandings. In any case, they need to be readily available.

#### Result of Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning concludes with the Scrum Team coming to a common understanding of the quantity and complexity of what is to be accomplished during the Sprint, and within a rational range of circumstances, expect to complete it. The Development Team forecasts the amount of work they will complete and commit to each other to accomplish it.The resulting list of things to do is the "Sprint Backlog".

### User Stories

**User stories** are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. All agile user stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality. 

See: http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories

**Convert User stories to tasks**: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7981316/breaking-a-projects-first-user-story-in-to-tasks

**Epic:** Scrum epic is a large user story. There's no magic threshold at which we call a particular story an epic. It just means “big user story.”  An epic can and should be divided in smaller stories.

**Theme**: is a collection of user stories.

### Activity: Product Backlog Refinement

Since Product Backlog Items are quite often large and general in nature, and since
ideas come and go and priorities change, Product Backlog Refinement is an ongoing
activity throughout a Scrum project. This activity includes but is not limited to
* keeping the Product Backlog ordered;
* removing or demoting items that no longer seem important;
* adding or promoting items that arise or become more important;
* splitting items into smaller items;
* merging items into larger items;
* estimating items.

One key benefit of the Product Backlog Refinement activity is to prepare for the upcoming Sprints. In aid of this, the refinement activity gives special attention to preparing items that are coming up for implementation. There are many things to consider, including but not limited to:

* Each item entering the Sprint should ideally represent an increment of "business
value".
* The Development Team needs to be able to build each item within a single
Sprint.
* Everyone needs to be clear on what is intended.
* Depending on the nature of the product, other skills and inputs may be needed. In every
case, Product Backlog Refinement is best considered as an activity for all the team
members, not just the Product Owner.


### Development 

With the Sprint Backlog in place, the Sprint begins, and the Development Team develops the new Product Increment defined by the Sprint Backlog.
During the Sprint, the Development Team self-organizes to produce a Product Increment in accord with the Sprint Backlog, as determined during Sprint Planning. 
Self-organizing means that the team responsibly produces the Product Increment in accord with all the organization's standards, according to the Definition of Done, and that the Development Team determines just how to go about that.

### Activity: Daily Scrum

The Development Team is self-organizing. The Development Team uses the Daily
Scrum meeting to ensure that they are on track for attaining the Sprint Goal. The
meeting takes place at the same time and place every day. Each Development Team
member gives three bits of information:
* What I have accomplished since our last Daily Scrum;
* What I plan to accomplish between now and our next Daily Scrum;
* What is impeding my progress.

There may be brief clarifying questions and answers, but there is no discussion of any
of these topics during the Daily Scrum. However, many teams meet right after the Daily
Scrum to work on any issues that have come up.
The Daily Scrum is not a report to management, nor to the Product Owner, nor to the
ScrumMaster. It is a communication meeting within the Development Team, to ensure
that they are all on the same page. Only the Scrum Team members, including
ScrumMaster and Product Owner, speak during this meeting. 
Other interested parties can come and listen in. 
Based on what comes up in the meeting, the Development Team reorganizes the work as needed to accomplish the Sprint Goal.

The Daily Scrum is a key element of Scrum, leading to transparency, trust, and better
performance. It provides rapid recognition of problems, and promotes the team's self-
organization and self-reliance. All Scrum meetings are time-boxed. The recommended
time-box for the Daily Scrum is no more than fifteen minutes.

### Activity: Sprint Review
At the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review the output of the
Sprint. All Scrum meetings are time-boxed. The recommended time box for the Sprint Review is one hour per week of Sprint duration.

The central point of discussion is the Product Increment completed during the Sprint.
Since the Stakeholders are those who have a "stake" in the results, it is generally wise and helpful for them to attend this meeting.
This is an informal meeting to take a look at where we are and to collaborate on how we might go forward. Everyone has input at the Sprint Review. Naturally, the Product Owner makes the final decisions about the future, updating the Product Backlog as appropriate.
Teams will find their own way to do the Sprint Review. A demonstration of the Product Increment is common. The group often discusses what they observed during the Sprint,what product ideas came to mind. They discuss the state of the Product Backlog and talk about possible completion dates and what might be done by those dates.

The Sprint Review gives everyone present an overview of the current Product Increment. In this light, it is common to update the Product Backlog as part of the Sprint Review.

### Activity: Sprint Retrospective

At the end of each Sprint, the Scrum Team meets for the Sprint Retrospective. The purpose is to review how things went with respect to the process, the relationships among people, and the tools. The team identifies what went well and not so well, and identifies potential improvements. They come up with a plan for improving things in the future. 
All Scrum meetings are time-boxed. The recommended time box for the Sprint Retrospective is one hour per week of Sprint duration.

### Daily Scrum Meeting

In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum.” Meetings are typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant.

There is an old joke in which a chicken and a pig are talking that illustrates a key concept in the daily scrum ...

Chcken: "Let's start a restaurant."
Pig: "Good idea, but what should we call it?"
Chicken: "How about 'Ham and Eggs'"
Pig: "No thanks. I'd be committed, you'd only be involved."

The joke is meant to point out the difference between those who are committed on a project and those who are only involved. Scrum affords special status to those who are committed, and many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum meeting.

All team members are required to attend scrum meetings. Since both the ScrumMaster and product owner are committed team members, they are expected to attend and participate. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson or a developer from another project) is allowed to attend, but is there only to listen. This makes scrum meetings an excellent way for a Scrum team to disseminate information -- if you're interested in hearing where things are at, attend that day's meeting.

The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:

What did you do yesterday?
What will you do today?
Are there any impediments in your way?
By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today, the team gains an excellent understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.

If a programmer stands up and says, "Today, I will finish the data storage module," everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he finished. This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of these commitments, and that their commitments are to one another, not to some far-off customer or salesman.

Any impediments that are raised in the scrum meeting become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible. Typical impediments are:

My ____ broke and I need a new one today.
I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.
I need help debugging a problem with ______.
I'm struggling to learn ______ and would like to pair with someone on it.
I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.
Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.
I can't get the ____ group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.
The department VP has asked me to work on something else "for a day or two."
In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical issues), he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.

The vast majority of teams conduct the daily scrum meeting by having each person answer the three questions in order. You answer all three, then the next person, the next and so on. An interesting alternative that some teams find helpful is to talk through one product backlog item before moving on to the next. In this way, an individual may give an update at multiple different times during the same meeting.
